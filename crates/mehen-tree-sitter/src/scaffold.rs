//! Shared scaffolding for per-language tree-sitter walkers.
//!
//! Every per-language walker (Go, C, Kotlin, …) shares the same shape:
//! a unit-rooted recursive cursor descent that maintains a per-space
//! `State` stack, a parallel `SpaceKind` stack, and a single-frame
//! `(nesting, depth, lambda)` cognitive context that saves/restores
//! around each subtree. The classification at each node — what counts
//! as a decision, what opens a space, which kinds are operators vs.
//! operands — is language-specific and lives in the per-language
//! crate.
//!
//! `WalkerHooks` exposes the language-specific seam. The host crate
//! implements it, then calls [`run`] to drive the walk. The
//! cognitive-context save/restore semantics, the `kinds` stack, the
//! `tree.open` / `tree.close` bookkeeping, and the unit-space
//! `set_span` / `finalize_state` / `apply_state_to` lifecycle live
//! here so they stay byte-identical across every consumer.
//!
//! Class-aware languages (Kotlin, Rust) need a hook that runs *before*
//! the space opens — see `WalkerHooks::pre_open`. Languages without
//! class-aware metrics leave it as the default no-op.
