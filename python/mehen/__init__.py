Mehen: Code Metrics Analysis Tool

A tool that computes and exports code metrics for Go, Python, Rust, and
TypeScript/TSX source code using Tree-sitter parsers for accurate AST-based
analysis.

This package provides the `mehen` command-line tool.
The main interface is the CLI binary, not Python imports.
