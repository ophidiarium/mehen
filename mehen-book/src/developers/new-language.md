# Supporting a new language

This section is to help developers implement support for a new language in `mehen`.

To implement a new language, two steps are required:

1. Generate the grammar
2. Add the grammar to `mehen`

A number of [metrics are supported](../metrics.md) and help to implement those are covered elsewhere in the documentation.

## Generating the grammar

As a **prerequisite** for adding a new grammar, there needs to exist a [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) version for the desired language that matches the [version used in this project](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/Cargo.toml).

The grammars are generated by a project in this repository called [enums](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/tree/master/enums). The following steps add the language support from the language crate and generate an enum file that is then used as the grammar in this project to evaluate metrics.

1. Add the language specific `tree-sitter` crate to the `enum` crate, making sure to tie it to the `tree-sitter` version used in the `mehen` crate. For example, for the Rust support at time of writing the following line exists in the [/enums/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/enums/Cargo.toml): `tree-sitter-rust = "version number"`.
2. Append the language to the `enum` crate in [/enums/src/languages.rs](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/enums/src/languages.rs). Keeping with Rust as the example, the line would be `(Rust, tree_sitter_rust)`. The first parameter is the name of the Rust enum that will be generated, the second is the `tree-sitter` function to call to get the language's grammar.
3. Add a case to the end of the match in `mk_get_language` macro rule in [/enums/src/macros.rs](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/enums/src/macros.rs) eg. for Rust `Lang::Rust => tree_sitter_rust::language()`.
4. Lastly, we execute the [/recreate-grammars.sh](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/recreate-grammars.sh) script that runs the `enums` crate to generate the grammar for the new language.

At this point we should have a new grammar file for the new language in [/src/languages/](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/tree/master/src/languages). See [/src/languages/language_rust.rs](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/src/languages/language_rust.rs) as an example of the generated enum.

## Adding the new grammar to mehen

1. Add the language specific `tree-sitter` crate to the `mehen` project, making sure to tie it to the `tree-sitter` version used in this project. For example, for the Rust support at time of writing the following line exists in the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/Cargo.toml): `tree-sitter-rust = "0.19.0"`.
2. Next we add the new `tree-sitter` language namespace to [/src/languages/mod.rs](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/src/languages/mod.rs) eg. 

```rust
pub mod language_rust;
pub use language_rust::*;
```

3. Lastly, we add a definition of the language to the arguments of `mk_langs!` macro in [/src/langs.rs](https://github.com/ophidiarium/mehen/blob/master/src/langs.rs).

```rust
// 1) Name for enum
// 2) Language description
// 3) Display name
// 4) Empty struct name to implement
// 5) Parser name
// 6) tree-sitter function to call to get a Language
// 7) file extensions
// 8) emacs modes
(
    Rust,
    "The `Rust` language",
    "rust",
    RustCode,
    RustParser,
    tree_sitter_rust,
    [rs],
    ["rust"]
)
```
